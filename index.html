    <p>hoby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free timeI have books of Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Panchtantra, Story of Prophets, etc. Books make me wise and keep me away from bad company. I love books so much that I often forget to take my food on time. I am proud of my hobby.reading a book is a hobby and is the best hobby one can ever have. ... That is because of one's love towards book reading. This love for reading books makes one read whenever one find time and even manage or make separate time to read book. This clearly is an indication that one is habituated to book reading.</p>
